Data == knowledge! Much of the data we use, whether it be from government repositories, social media, GitHub, or e-commerce sites comes from public-facing APIs. The quantity of data available is truly staggering, but munging JSON output into a format that is easily analyzable in R is an equally staggering undertaking. When JSON is turned into an R object, it usually becomes a deeply nested list riddled with missing values that is difficult to untangle into a tidy format. Moreover, every API presents its own challenges; code you've written to clean up data from GitHub isn't necessarily going to work on Twitter data, as each API spews data out in its own unique, headache-inducing nested list structure. To ease and generalize this process, [Amanda Dobbyn proposed](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf18/issues/24) an #unconf18 project for a general API response tidier! Welcome `roomba`, our first stab at easing the process of tidying nested lists!

`roomba` will eventually be able to walk nested lists in a variety of different structures from JSON output, replace  `NULL` or `.empty` values with `NA`s or a user-specified value, and return a `tibble` with names matching a user-specified list. Of course, in two days we haven't *fully* achieved this vision, but we're off to a promising start.


## The birth of roomba


It was clear Amanda was on to something good by the lively discussion in the [#runconf18](https://github.com/ropensci/unconf18/issues/) issues repository leading up to the unconf. Thanks to input from Jenny Bryan, Jim Hester, Carl Boettinger, Scott Chamberlain, Bob Rudis, and Noam Ross, we had a lot of ideas to work with when the unconf began. Fortunately, Jim already had a function called `dfs_idx()` ([here](https://github.com/ropenscilabs/roomba/blob/master/R/dfs_idx.R)) written to perform depth-first searches of nested lists from the [GitNub GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/v4/). With the core list-traversal code out of the way, we split our efforts between developing a usable interface, stockpiling `.JSON` files to test on, and developing a Shiny app.


## What's working
We've got the basic structure of `roomba` sorted out, and you should install it from GitHub to try out! Here are a few of the examples we've put together. 


```{r}
library(roomba)
#load twitter data example
data(twitter_data)

#roomba-fy!
roomba(twitter_data, c("created_at", "name"))
```

And just the *first* element of the `twitter_data` list will show you that `roomba` has simplified this process quite a bit.

```{r}
twitter_data[[1]]

```

We created a Shiny app too, which in its current state allows you to select a `.Rda` or `.JSON` file, pick two variables, and create a scatterplot of them.


Run the app like this:
```{r eval=FALSE}
shiny_roomba()
```

## What's not
Of course, in two days we weren't able to build a magical one-size-fits-all solution to every API response data headache. Right now, the main barrier to usability is that both the `roomba()` function and `shiny_roomba()` app only work on sub-list items of the same length and same data type stored at the same depth. To illustrate on the `twitter_data`:

```{r}
#This doesn't work because "user" has data of different types and lengths
roomba(twitter_data, c("user"))


#This doesn't work because "name" and "retweet_count" are at different depths.
roomba(twitter_data, c("name","retweet_count"))
```


In addition, we've got some features we want to add, such as handling a larger variety of column names (i.e. passing a string for a single column name, keeping all values even if they are all `NULL`). We would love your feedback on other things we can add!
